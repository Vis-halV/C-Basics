The unique purpose of these shifting operators are that they both perform an unique mathematcical operations, lets  discuss below 

    i) Bitwise << left shift 
        It is used to multiply an decimal a with 2^b
        when a << b

        a * 2^b

    ii) Bitwise << left shift 
        It is used to divide an decimal a with 2^b
        when a >> b
        
        that is a / 2^b

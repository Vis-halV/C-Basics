Arrays
    - Same data types are stored 
    -  Contiguous in memory alloaction
    -  Index starts from 0 and ends n - 1 
    -  It  is a non premitive data type

Macros 
    - INT_MAX and INT MIN which has the highest and smallest value of an integer which is used to compare some values whether it is smallest or the biggest.

Pass by Rreference
    - In primitive data type like int, float the value is passed 
    but in non-primitive data type like arrays, lists, etc the address of the element is passed to the function.
    - If the value is passed by value it does not affect the value globally,
    - But when value is passed by reference it affects the value globally.

Linear Search 
    - This is called linear search because the elements of an array is searched linearly.
    - It has complexity of O(n) in the worst case senario.
    - In simple words this explains that it takes as much long 
    to find an element in the nth position. We will learn that later in the time complexity chapter.

Arrays
    Same data types are stored 
    Contiguous in memory alloaction
    Index starts from 0 and ends n - 1 
    It  is a non premitive data type

Macros 
    INT_MAX and INT MIN which has the highest and smallest value of an integer which is used to compare some values whether it is smallest or the biggest.

Linear Search 
    This is called linear search because the elements of an array is searched linearly.
    It has complexity of O(n) in the worst case senario.
    In simple words this explains that it takes as much long 
    to find an element in the nth position. We will learn that later in the time complexity chapter.
